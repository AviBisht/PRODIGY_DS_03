I used AI tools to help guide me through this project, but I made sure to understand what I was building every step of the way. I trained a Decision Tree Classifier, explored how changing its depth affects accuracy, and learned how to interpret the model’s predictions using visualizations and evaluation metrics. Along the way, I tried to grasp concepts like overfitting, feature importance, and class imbalance—not just to finish the task, but to genuinely understand how machine learning works in practice. This project pushed me to think critically, experiment with different approaches, and grow more confident working with real-world data.
